            <h3>Why Not Just Take A Picture Of A Cat Myself</h3>  
            <p>Easy there tiger.  Do you know how dangerous cats are?  Cats are little balls of fur, fangs, and claws.  Encountering one in the wild is a dangerous, sometimes deadly, occourence.  Not mention we are pretty sure you're not a professional photographer.  We've seen some of those pictures you post online (we have your information, remember?), and let's just say you're no "Nick Nichols"...sorry, "Who's that?" you say.  Just a famous wildlife photographer, something you would probably know if you were a professional photographer.  So leave the cat pictures to us, and you just keep surfing the web.</p>

            <h3>Can I Get More Cat Pictures?</h3>  
            <p>YES!  But, you will have to give us some new, valid information.  We reccomend friends or family as they are easy to obtain personal information from.  You don't even have to tell them, what its for.  For every person's information you collect for us, we will give you another cat picture!#</p>
